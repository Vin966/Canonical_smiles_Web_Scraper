# Canonical_smiles_Web_Scraper

The jupyter notebook stored in this repository has been used to web scrape canonical SMILES and other relevant information with regard to metabolites produced by ethnobotanical plants. This has been used as part of a project done under Experteze to collate a database of canonical SMILES and other relevant information in order to screen the obtained results for docking. Also contained within the notebook is an SDF downloader to quickly download a number of SDF files based on the canonical smiles obtained.
